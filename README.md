# State of the Map poster submission
_by Florian Zenoni_

## Summary
The following poster selected at the 2018 edition of the State of the Map (SotM) conference includes two maps that are generated by a series of scripts. The computational part is done thanks to a local instance of Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM), called thanks to a script that queries the C++ library API. The analysis of the raw data as well as the manipulation of the spatial objects are taken care of by a set of scripts written in the R language.

## What is included and what is not
This GitHub repository includes all of the aforementioned scripts.
What is not included is that local OSRM instance, as well as the OpenStreetMap (OSM) map of the Northwestern Italian regions used by the routing engine. Therefore, to fully reproduce the workflow, you will first need to set-up the OSRM back-end accordingly. This README does not cover this part. All information can be found at the [official OSRM Wiki](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki).
